# Laravel API DOC

This library is based on [Scribe for Laravel](https://scribe.knoxlabs.dev/), a powerful tool for generating API documentation in Laravel applications. We have updated and customized it to match the design and architecture of **Teelaunch**, ensuring a seamless integration with our platform.

## Key Updates:
- Adjusted documentation structure to align with Teelaunch's API flow.
- Show end-point method on the left side of the drop down
- Optimized response formatting to reflect Teelaunch's data models.
- Improved styling to match Teelaunch's UI/UX guidelines.
- Improve HtmlWriter.php to match the new badges
- Fix couple of wrong CSS that affect the design of the app

These updates ensure that the API documentation remains clear, accurate, and well-integrated with our system. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!
